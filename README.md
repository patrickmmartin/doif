# doif
need to automate doing something if something else?

* This is a snippet mainly playing the part in the scaffolding of a target based system, like say,  ... make .... that has `remedial actions` that need applying.
* the tool is python, and seems pretty cross platform, to my level of caring
* there is a test runner ./test.sh | test.bat and a test Makefile that has target dependencies and the actual "work done" dreiven by the variable `action`
